## Stakeholder Meeting Simulation Prompt

Help me simulate a stakeholder meeting with **[name of stakeholder]** to prepare me in advance.

This exercise should prepare me to arrive at the real conversation less defensive, ready for objections, and prepared to make sure the stakeholder feels heard.

- **The meeting is scheduled regarding:** [AGENDA/GENERAL TOPIC]
- **Hard mode:** Have the stakeholder try to trigger me.

Throughout the conversation, give me ***out of simulation coaching notes*** on what I could do better.
